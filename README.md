Rate the restaurants you have with a star system, 1 star being the worst and 5 stars being the best.
<br />

It shows the address of the Chipotle at 7028 W palmetto Park Road Ste 106, Boca Raton, FL 33433. Then at the bottom with a Rate Chipotle showing 5 empty stars to give your rating and a submit button at the bottom to submit the rating](./Detail_page.png)
